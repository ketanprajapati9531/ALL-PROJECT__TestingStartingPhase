# ALL-PROJECT__TestingStartingPhase
When I began my journey as a QA Tester in a startup company, I had no prior knowledge of testing. However, I embarked on a learning journey to master manual testing.

I delved deep into testing every project, ensuring thorough examination. I made it a point to meet with the client and grasp a full understanding of the project during its development stages. This process was repeated as needed.

I meticulously prepared all necessary documentation, including requirements gathering, test plan creation, and test scenario formulation. Additionally, I crafted test cases to ensure comprehensive testing coverage. These test cases were thoroughly reviewed by both myself and the CEO of the company.

Upon execution, I diligently logged all discovered bugs into Trello for tracking and resolution. As time progressed, I transitioned to working on projects in English, adhering to proper Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) methodologies.

In summary, despite the initial challenges and the language barrier, I evolved into a proficient manual tester, contributing effectively to the company's projects.
